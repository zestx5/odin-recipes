    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A Gold Rush cocktail is a riff on a whiskey sour using honey syrup instead
      of simple syrup. The honey syrup is commonly made with a 1:1 ratio of
      honey to water, but I find that a 2:1 ratio helps to better balance out
      the lemon juice and bourbon. This makes enough syrup for 4 cocktails.
      Serve over a large ice sphere.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>Honey Syrup:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cocktail:</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups ice</li>
      <li>2 fluid ounces bourbon</li>
      <li>3/4 fluid ounce honey syrup</li>
      <li>3/4 fluid ounce fresh lemon juice</li>
      <li>lemon twist, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>
        In a small saucepan, combine honey and water over medium heat. Bring to
        a simmer, stirring, until honey is dissolved. Remove from heat and cool
        completely. To account for evaporation, add a splash of water to bring
        the total volume of syrup up to 3 fluid ounces, if necessary.
